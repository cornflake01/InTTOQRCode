We didn't finish apply the custom fonts and sizes.
You could rewrite the code on the generate route if you want,
because I think that it needs refactoring or rewriting.
It lacks efficiency and code readability.

Also use your own google account for the googleapi
because I will be removing it on my account.
For the credentials of the InTTO QR System google
account and MongoDB account ask Sir Jimmy about it.
